The sky roars with a great clamor, like the sound of a thousand trains. The daytime sky becomes dark as sunlight is blotted out. Is it a terrible thunderstorm? No, it's actually a flock of thousands of passenger pigeons zooming overhead! Hundreds of years ago, there were three to five billion passenger pigeons in America, and the incredible sight of a flock's flight was a regular event. Sadly, passenger pigeons are extinct. None are left today.\nPassenger pigeons were a migratory bird. Migratory birds move about from season to season searching for places to nest and feed. The passenger pigeon migration ranged from Canada all the way to Texas and Florida. During a migration, thousands of birds would fly together from morning to night for several days. People reported seeing flocks as large as a mile wide! The migrations took place in spring and fall, when warmer weather brought forests to life with fresh food sources like nuts, seeds, berries, and insects.\nAt first, it seemed as though passenger pigeons were an endless supply of tasty meat. When a massive flock passed by, hunters could easily catch a few passenger pigeons without affecting the others. But later, hunters would travel to find nesting sites. A passenger pigeon nesting site might contain over one million birds. The birds usually nested close together, and hunters found them to be easy targets.\nEventually this overhunting destroyed the pigeon population. The last known passenger pigeon in the world died at the Cincinnati Zoological Garden in 1914. The pigeon, named Martha, was twenty-nine years old. Although the extinction of the passenger pigeon is a terrible loss, it did have one happy result: it pushed people to create wildlife protection laws to protect other creatures from a similar fate.\n\nBased on the text, which of the following things made the passenger pigeon migration a special event?\nA. Only people in Florida and Texas could see the migration.\nB. The migration only happened every one hundred years.\nC. The sun was blocked out by huge flocks of birds.\nD. The migration caused warmer weather and forest growth.\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.", "answer": "C"}

Its chemical structure depends on the number and types of atoms in each of its molecules, as well as on how those atoms are arranged.\nOne property of a substance is its flavor, which is its odor and taste combined. The chemical structure of a substance determines both the kind of flavor it has and the strength of that flavor.\nSyrups containing flavorants are used to add flavor to snow cones.\nSubstances that have especially interesting and strong flavors are often added to food to change or enhance the food's flavor. These substances are called flavorants. Flavorants can be found in nature, made in a chemical factory, or both.\nOne example of a flavorant is methyl anthranilate. This flavorant is often used to add a grape flavor to syrups, candy, and other sweets. Methyl anthranilate is found naturally in certain types of grapes, but it can also be made by workers in a chemical factory.\n\nWhich of the following statements is true?\nA. A substance's chemical structure depends only on the number and types of atoms in each molecule of the substance.\nB.

Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nThe eyes of fruit flies look red because they contain molecules called pigments, which color the eyes red. Cells in the eyes of fruit flies have parts that make these pigments from other molecules.\nThe molecules that will become pigments are brought inside these cell parts by a protein called a transporter. This transporter protein is encoded by the w gene.\nScientists in a lab found a fruit fly that had white eyes. This fly had a mutation in its w gene. Compared to the w gene without a mutation, the mutated w gene encoded a form of the transporter protein with a different structure.\nThis different form of the transporter protein could not bring molecules into the parts of the fly's eye cells where pigments are made. So, the fly's eyes had no pigments.\nFigure: a white fly eye (left) and a red fly eye.\n\nComplete the sentence.\nThe mutation in the () affected the structure and function of the ().\nA. transporter protein . . . w gene\nB. w gene . . . transporter protein\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.", "answer": "B"}

Some other mammalian species, though, are ruminants, which means that their stomachs have four chambers instead of one. Ruminants are perhaps most well-known for how much chewing they do during their digestive process. When a ruminant, such as a deer, eats food, the first two chambers of the animal's stomach extract the liquid from the food. The solid remainder of the food, known as the cud, is then regurgitated back into the animal's mouth to be chewed again. This allows the animal to extract more nutrients than it would otherwise.

A single ant colony may have millions of ants living together in a nest with many tunnels and rooms. The queen ant is the head of the colony, but each ant in the colony has a job to do. The queen ant produces all of the eggs, while young female worker ants care for the eggs. Worker ants also dig tunnels and keep the nest clean.

{"image": "MMPR-v1.2-prompts/correctness_images/scienceqa_multi_choice_en_20240402_extracted/train/18325/image.png", "question": "Read the text about the blue dragon.\nDo dragons exist? Believe it or not, the oceans contain a lizard-like creature called the blue glaucus or blue dragon. However, these \"dragons\" are not the fire-breathing beasts of fantasy. In fact, they are only about an inch long. Blue dragons are a type of sea slug.\nAlthough these slugs are cuter than legendary dragons, you shouldn't let their squishy bodies fool you. These tiny creatures can be dangerous! Blue dragons eat poisonous sea creatures, such as Portuguese man-of-wars. The blue dragons store their prey's venom in their many \"fingers.\" They can then use that stored poison to defend themselves. So, never touch a blue dragon\u2014unless you want to get a painful and possibly serious sting.\nBlue dragons have another way to stay safe from predators. They float on their backs so their bright blue bellies point upward. The blue blends in with the water, making it hard for predators flying overhead to see them. And predators swimming below will have trouble spotting the dragons' gray backs. The light color blends with the sunlight shining down through the water. This two-color effect is called countershading, and it's a good way to avoid getting eaten!\nYou might see blue dragons washed up on some beaches, but they usually drift on warm surfaces of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans. An air bubble in their stomach allows them to float for long periods of time. It is difficult for scientists to find these tiny creatures in the vast oceans. So, there is still much we don't know about them. What we do know, though, is that these beautiful dragons are full of surprising traits.\n\nBased on the text, why are blue dragons dangerous?\nA. They have razor-sharp teeth and sharp fingers.\nB. They use weapons to catch food.\nC. Their sting is painful and can harm humans.\nD. Their strong fingers squeeze prey.\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.", "answer": "C"}

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nBrandon, a materials engineer, was developing a quick-drying fabric for athletic clothing. The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Brandon thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use.\nSo, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed.\nFigure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water.\n\nWhich of the following could Brandon's test show?\nA. how long it would take the sample fabric to dry after it absorbed one drop of water\nB. how much athletes would sweat in the fabric\nC. if the sample fabric would absorb one drop of water in less than one second\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.", "answer": "A"}
{"image": "MMPR-v1.2-prompts/correctness_images/scienceqa_multi_choice_en_20240402_extracted/train/17916/image.png", "question": "Read the text about sloths.\nSloths are known for being one of the slowest animals on the planet. They also sleep up to twenty hours every day. Even though sloths are lethargic, they manage to stay safe by living in the treetops of South and Central America. Sloths have special qualities that help them spend their lives hanging from branches.\nFor example, sloths' long fur grows in the opposite direction from that of most animals. Most animals' fur grows downward, which helps rainwater run down off the animal. Sloths' fur, however, grows upward. When a sloth is hanging upside down, rainwater is still directed off its body. This helps the sloth dry off more quickly. Sloth fur has another special purpose. Each strand of fur has grooves that collect algae. The algae give the sloth a greenish color, which helps it blend in with its leafy environment. Along with sloths' slow movement, this disguise makes sloths hard for predators to spot.\nSloths also have long, curved claws on their front and back legs. Sloths can use their claws to protect themselves from predators. More importantly, the long, sharp claws curve around branches for a powerful grip. In this way, sloths' claws keep them from slipping and falling out of trees.\nHanging upside down all day can be hard for other reasons. In most animals, hanging would cause the stomach, heart, and other organs to press on the lungs. Not for sloths, though. Sloths have special bands of tissue called adhesions that help attach certain organs to the rib cage. These bands of tissue hold the organs in place so they don't press down on the sloth's lungs. Thus the sloth stays healthy and comfortable while hanging in its upside-down world.\n\nBased on the text, how does a sloth's fur help protect it?\nA. A sloth's fur protects its important organs.\nB. A sloth's fur helps it hide from predators.\nC. A sloth's fur helps it cling to tree branches.\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.", "answer": "B"}

Substances with different chemical structures have different physical and chemical properties.\nWhen a substance is a reactant in a chemical reaction, its chemical structure changes. During the reaction, the atoms that make up the reactants are rearranged to form products. After the reaction, the products together are composed of the same atoms as the reactants, but those atoms are arranged in a different way. So, the products have different chemical structures than the reactants.\nThe chemical reaction that produces soap is called saponification.

The world's largest rodent, the capybara! Also called capys, these animals enjoy being in wetlands and rain forest waters. They are strong swimmers that wade in mud to keep cool. Like guinea pigs, capys have short legs and chubby bodies with shaggy fur. Much like hippos, capys have their eyes, ears, and nostrils located high on their heads. This helps them check out their surroundings while staying mostly underwater. Staying out of sight is important when you're the favorite food of jaguars and snakes! Luckily, capybaras can hide underwater for five minutes at a time. Plus, their webbed toes help them paddle fast.\nCapybaras live in Central and South America, usually in groups of between ten and forty. They eat plants like grass, reeds, grains, melons, and squash. They eat a lot of tough plants that are rich in fiber. To help break the plants down, capybaras have long teeth that chew side to side. They also have special bacteria in their guts that help break down fiber.\nThough capybaras are happiest in the wild, they are easily trained. Zookeepers have taught these gentle rodents to walk onto scales to be weighed, go into crates, and sit still for physical exams. How do they do it? Food treats and belly rubs are fun rewards. Capybaras are so quick to learn that one was once used as a guide animal for a blind man in Suriname.\nThe capybara population is mostly stable, but capys are still threatened by deforestation. When large areas of trees are cleared, it reduces the capybaras' shelter. But now, people are starting to limit the number of trees people can cut in rain forests. This is good news for capybaras, as their home is being protected.\n\nWhich sentence correctly describes capybaras?\nA. They are shy animals that usually hide in tall grass.\nB.

{"image": "MMPR-v1.2-prompts/correctness_images/scienceqa_multi_choice_en_20240402_extracted/train/21026/image.png", "question": "Read the text about bats.\nSeveral kinds of animals \"talk\" to one another in the wild. Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\n\nBased on the text, how are fruit bats different from most other animals?\nA. They can understand some human speech.\nB. They can communicate with many kinds of animals.\nC. They can \"talk\" directly to one other fruit bat.\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.", "answer": "C"}

He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Cooper put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\n\nWhich of the following could Cooper's test show?\nA. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nB. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nC. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.", "answer": "B"}

Helping return these nutrients to the ecosystem are detritivores and decomposers, both of which feed on dead organic matter. Detritivores, such as worms and some millipedes, eat and internally digest small chunks of dead organic matter. Decomposers, in contrast, often don't have mouths, so they must externally digest the dead organic matter. They break the matter into simpler parts, often dissolving it, and then absorb the broken-down matter. Fungi and bacteria are examples of decomposers. By breaking dead organic matter down, decomposers return some nutrients directly to the ecosystem. Other organisms also eat detritivores and decomposers, and nutrients return to the ecosystem in this way, too.\n\nWhich term matches the picture?\nA. detritivore\nB. decomposer\nAnswer with the option's letter from the given choices directly.", "answer": "B"}

Read the passage about a specific animal behavior. Then, follow the instructions below.\n\nBlack-headed gulls build their nests on the ground. The gulls' eggs, chicks, and nests are brown, so they blend in with the sand, twigs, and dry grass around them. But the inside of a gull's eggshell is white. When an egg hatches, the white of the broken eggshell stands out from the brown nest. This makes it easier for crows and other predators to find the nest and eat the offspring in it.\nAfter an egg hatches, the parent gull leaves the nest to carry the broken eggshell away. This helps the nest blend in with the environment again. It is harder for predators to find offspring in a nest that blends in with the environment.\nFigure: a black-headed gull carrying a broken eggshell.\n\nWhy might removing broken eggshells from the nest increase the reproductive success of a black-headed gull?
